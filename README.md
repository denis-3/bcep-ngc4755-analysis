# Photometric Analysis Algorithms

Least-squares prewhitening, Lomb-Scargle, and O-C period change algorithms used in a paper on beta Cepheids in the cluster NGC 4755. More information will come as it is published.

To use the code, first download `main.js` and install the dependencies with `npm i nodeplotlib prando regression`. Then, configure the analysis type, analysis parameters, and data files in the beginning lines of the code; comments placed there should offer additional description of what the different variables do. Finally, run the script with `node main`.
